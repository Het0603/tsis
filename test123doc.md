# Me No Get It ðŸ¤ª

Uh... what? Me brain feel all mushy inside. Too many big fancy words make head go spinny-spin. Can nice person please say again but use teeny tiny baby words? Me very confused.

## Why So Hard?

* Words too long and tricky

* Sentences make no sense to simple brain

* Too much thinking make me sleepy ðŸ˜´

## Me Need Help!

1. Break down into itsy-bitsy pieces

2. Use pictures or hand gestures maybe?

3. Speak real slow like talking to pet rock

## Brain Go Boom ðŸ¤¯

Me think me might need to take long nap now. All this learning stuff make grey blob in skull feel like exploding. Maybe after sleepy time, me understand better? Or maybe me just too dumb to ever get it. Who knows!

**Duhhhhh...** ðŸ¥´ Me give up for now. Time for snack and TV. Thinking is for smart people, not for silly billy like me!
